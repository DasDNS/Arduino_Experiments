# ESP32 Web-Based WAV Audio Recorder

This project demonstrates how to record stereo audio using the ESP32's I2S interface and save it as a WAV file using LittleFS. The recorded audio is then hosted via a web server on the ESP32 for download.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Records **stereo audio** (2 channels) at **16 kHz** sampling rate using I2S
- Stores audio as a **WAV file** on the ESP32's internal flash using **LittleFS**
- Serves the recorded audio file over Wi-Fi using an **Async Web Server**
- Displays progress via serial monitor during recording
- Automatically stops recording after a defined time (default: 20 seconds)
